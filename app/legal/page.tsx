          FLAT·SIX is a free, open-source hobby project — not a company, not a product, and not affiliated with Porsche AG.
          There is no business here, so there is not much to hide behind. This page says plainly what happens to your data
          and the terms under which you use the app.

        <Section id="privacy" kicker="01 · PRIVACY" title="Privacy">
          <P>
            This project is run by an individual as open-source software. It is not a commercial service, and your data is
            never sold, rented, shared for advertising, or used to train anything. There are no ad networks and no
            third-party analytics or tracking pixels.
          </P>

          <H3>What is stored</H3>
          <P>
            To sign in, the app stores your <strong>email address</strong>, used only to send the magic sign-in link and to
            identify your account. If you choose to use the app, it stores the data <strong>you</strong> enter: your
            vehicle details and your service records (dates, mileage, parts, costs and notes). That is the entire scope.
          </P>

          <H3>Where it is stored</H3>
          <P>
            Accounts and your records live in a <strong>Supabase</strong> (PostgreSQL) database, protected by row-level
            security so each account can only read and write its own rows. Supabase processes this data on the project
            owner&rsquo;s behalf as a hosting provider. Reference data — component diagrams, part numbers and torque specs —
            is static and shared by everyone; it is not personal data.
          </P>

          <H3>Claude / MCP</H3>
          <P>
            If you connect your garage to Claude over MCP, requests run with your approval and can read and write the same
            records you can. Nothing is sent to an AI model unless you initiate it. The project owner does not pipe your
            data into any model in the background.
          </P>

          <H3>Cookies</H3>
          <P>
            The only cookies set are the session cookies required to keep you signed in. There are no marketing or
            tracking cookies.
          </P>

          <H3>Your control</H3>
          <P>
            Your records belong to you. You can edit or delete them at any time from within the app, and you can request
            deletion of your account and all associated data. Because the project is open source, you are also free to run
            your own copy and keep everything entirely on infrastructure you control.
